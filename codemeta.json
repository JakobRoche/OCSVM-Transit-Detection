    "name": "OCSVM-Transit-Detection: One-Class SVM model for exoplanet transit detection",
    "description": "This One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) model detects exoplanet transit events. One-class SVMs fit data and make predictions faster than simple CNNs, and do not require specialized equipment such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU). The code uses a Gaussian kernel to compute a nonlinear decision boundary. After training, OCSVM-Transit-Detection requires that lightcurves classified as containing a transit have features very similar to the lightcurves in the training dataset, thus limiting misclassifications.",
